	abstract="The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is gaining popularity as a co-processor to the Central Processing Unit (CPU). However, harnessing its capabilities is a non-trivial exercise that requires good knowledge of parallel programming, more so when the complexity of these applications is increasingly rising. Languages such as StreamIt [1] and Lime [2] have addressed the offloading of composed computations to GPUs. However, to the best of our knowledge, no support exists at library level. To this extent, we propose Marrow, an algorithmic skeleton framework for the orchestration of OpenCL computations. Marrow expands the set of skeletons currently available for GPU computing, and enables their combination, through nesting, into complex structures. Moreover, it introduces optimizations that overlap communication and computation, thus conjoining programming simplicity with performance gains in many application scenarios. We evaluated the framework from a performance perspective, comparing it against hand-tuned OpenCL programs. The results are favourable, indicating that Marrow's skeletons are both flexible and efficient in the context of GPU computing.",

@book{LBMBook,
	abstract = {This book is an introduction to the theory, practice, and implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, a powerful computational fluid dynamics method that is steadily gaining attention due to its simplicity, scalability, extensibility, and simple handling of complex geometries. The book contains chapters on the method's background, fundamental theory, advanced extensions, and implementation.
	To aid beginners, the most essential paragraphs in each chapter are highlighted, and the introductory chapters on various LB topics are front-loaded with special "in a nutshell" sections that condense the chapter's most important practical results. Together, these sections can be used to quickly get up and running with the method. Exercises are integrated throughout the text, and frequently asked questions about the method are dealt with in a special section at the beginning. In the book itself and through its web page, readers can find example codes showing how the LB method can be implemented efficiently on a variety of hardware platforms, including multi-core processors, clusters, and graphics processing units. Students and scientists learning and using the LB method will appreciate the wealth of clearly presented and structured information in this volume.},
